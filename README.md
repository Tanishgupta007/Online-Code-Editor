## Project Description:
This project presents the development of an innovative online code editor tailored for web development, accommodating the creation and manipulation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The platform provides users with a seamless coding experience, empowering them to write, edit, and experiment with their code in real-time. A key feature of the editor is the integration of a live preview panel, offering users immediate and dynamic visual feedback on their code output. This not only enhances the efficiency of the coding process but also facilitates a more interactive and responsive development environment. The editor's user-friendly interface, combined with its real-time preview functionality, aims to streamline the web development workflow, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and experienced developers alike.
